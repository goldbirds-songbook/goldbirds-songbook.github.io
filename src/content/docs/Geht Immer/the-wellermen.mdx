title: The Wellermen

#### Verse 1
There once was a ship that put to sea  
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea  
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down  
O blow, my bully boys, blow (Huh!)  
  
#### Chorus  
Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go  
  
#### Verse 2  
She had not been two weeks from shore  
When down on her, a right whale bore  
The captain called all hands and swore  
He'd take that whale in tow (Huh!)  
  
**Chorus**  


#### Verse 3  
Before the boat had hit the water  
The whale's tail came up and caught her  
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her  
When she dived down low (Huh!)  

**Chorus**  

  
#### Verse 4  
No line was cut, no whale was freed  
The Captain's mind was not of greed  
But he belonged to the Wellerman's creed  
She took that ship in tow (Huh!)  
  
**Chorus**  
  
#### Verse 5  
For forty days, or even more  
The line went slack, then tight once more  
All boats were lost, there were only four  
But still that whale did go (Huh!)  
  
**Chorus**  

#### Verse 6  
As far as I've heard, the fight's still on  
The line's not cut and the whale's not gone  
The Wellerman makes his regular call  
To encourage the Captain, crew, and all (Huh!)  
  
#### Chorus  
Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go (Huh!)  

Soon may the Wellerman come  
To bring us sugar and tea and rum  
One day, when the tonguin' is done  
We'll take our leave and go
