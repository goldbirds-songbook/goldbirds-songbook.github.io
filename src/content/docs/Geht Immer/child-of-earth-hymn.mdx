The sun and the moon  
The stars and the trees  
The wind and the air  
All come to me :|   
  
Because I am a child of Love  
Because I am a child of Earth  
Because I am a child of All  
Who created the beauty of the world :|  
  
Healing comes from our Sisters. 
Healing comes from our Brothers  
Healing comes from our Mothers. 
Healing comes from the earth :|  
  
Because I am a child of Love  
Because I am a child of Earth   
Because I am a child of All  
Who created the beauty of the world :|
