**Chorus:**  
*Am Em, C G Am*  
Fire child sing, fire child dance,  
Fire child you’ll be mine.  
Fire-child sing, fire child dance,  
Fire-child you are mine.  
 
*Am Am, C G Am*  
Light streaming, light streaming,  
Making my fire-child grow.  
Light streaming, light streaming,  
Making my fire-child glow.  

Chorus...  
  
Air breathe across the embers…  

Chorus...  
  
Earth walk, walk in beauty…  

Chorus... 
  
Bright rivers are flowing,  
Making my fire-child grow.  
Light flowing and growing,  
Making my fire-child glow.  

Chorus...
