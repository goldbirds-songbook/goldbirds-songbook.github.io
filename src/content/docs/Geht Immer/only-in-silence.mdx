Only In Silence the Word,  
Only in Dark the Light,  
Only in Dying, Life,  
Bright the hawk's flight on the empty sky.  


To call the word,  
to raise the silence  
of all life  
and fly  
To call the wind,  
to brave the silence  
and honor all  
that's died.

> *This song has travelled far. Beginning with the words of Ursula K. Le Guin, in her her novel "A Wizard of EarthSea." It was put into melody by a man named ______, and then was taught in many song circles, one of which I happened to be in and I fell in love with the melody, the poem, and the key it offers my heart. I added a second part that layers on top of the round.*
