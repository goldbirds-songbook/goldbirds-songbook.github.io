### Latvian

Tiesa, tiesa, ne meliņi... [līgo, līgo!]  
Vecu ļaužu valodiņā... [līgo, līgo!] x2  
Jāņu naktī meitas gāja  
Raganās(i), vilkacēs(i)  
   
Jāņi, Jāņi šovakar(i)  
Kam tie Jāņi piederēja?  
Raganām(i), vilkacēm(i)  
Tām tie Jāņi piederēja  
   
Skrien ragana šķērsu gaisu  
Ne manā(jā) sētiņā  
Mana sēta dzelžiem kalta  
Adatām(i) jumti jumti  
   
Adatām(i) jumti jumti  
Izkaptēm(i) spāres celtas  
Adatām(i) nosadurti  
Izkaptēm(i) nosagriezti  
   
Sviesta pienā upe teka  
Manā govju laidarā(jā)  
Tur nolauza skauģis kaklu  
Tur deviņas raganiņas  
Tur noslīka Laumas meitas  
Bez saulītes vakarā(jā)  

### English Translation

Its true, Its true, there lay no lies (sway [1], sway)  
In the old native language (sway, sway)  
During summer solstice night the girls become  
Witches and werewolves  
   
Summer solstice, Summer solstice is tonight  
Who does summer solstice belong to?  
Witches and werewolves  
summer solstice belongs to them  
   
The witch ran through the air ...  
Not in my backyard  
My yard is forged with iron  
Needles on my roof  
   
Needles on my roof  
Caught up in the rafters  
Needles stabbed  
Rafters cut  
   
The river flowed like buttermilk  
In my cows' pasture  
There the hunter broke its neck  
and stood nine witches,  
Drowning was the woodlands fae [2]  
Without the sun in the evening.

[1] The midsummer festival in Latvia is referred to as Ligo, but the word also roughly translates to mean a swaying or rocking dance 

[2] The Lauma in Latvian folklore is a woodland fae or goddess who appears as a beautiful woman. She's generally regarded as a temperamental entity who may prey upon men or kidnap children, but are also can summon rain and perform high quality domestic work. They are strongly associated with blessings or curses on children, and with cow's milk. They are afraid of iron.
