We shall be known by the company we keep  
By the ones who circle round to tend these fires  
We shall be known by the ones who sow and reap  
The seeds of change, alive from deep within the earth  
It is time now, it is time now that we thrive  
It is time we lead ourselves into the well  
It is time now, and what a time to be alive   
In this Great Turning we shall learn to lead in love  
In this Great Turning we shall learn to lead in love
