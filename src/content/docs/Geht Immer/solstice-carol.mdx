A fire is burning  
The long night draws near  
All who need comfort  
Are welcome by here  

We'll dance 'neath the stars  
And toast the past year  
For the Spirit of Solstice  
Is still living here   

We'll count all our blessings  
While the Mother lays down  
With snow as her blanket  
Covering the ground  

Thanks to the Mother  
For the life that she brings  
She'll waken to warm us  
Again in the Spring   

The poor and the hungry  
The sick and the lost   
These are our children   
No matter the Cost  
  
Come by the fire   
The harvest to share  
For the Spirit of Solstice  
Is still living here  

A fire is burning  
The long night draws near  
All who need comfort  
Are welcome by here  

We'll dance 'neath the stars  
And toast the past year  
For the Spirit of Solstice  
Is still living here
