title:  Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree
---

Rockin' around the Christmas tree At the Christmas party hop Mistletoe hung where you can see Ev'ry couple tries to stop

Rockin' around the Christmas tree Let the Christmas spirit ring Later we'll have some pumpkin pie And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling When you hear Voices singing "Lets be Jolly Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rockin' around the Christmas tree Have a happy holiday Ev'ryone dancing merrily In the new Old fashioned way

(mit Wiederhohlung)
