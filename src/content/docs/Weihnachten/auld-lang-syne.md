title:  Auld Lang Syne

1.) Should auld acquaintance be forgot, A-and never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot And the days of Auld Lang Syne.

For Au-auld La-ang Syne, my dear, For Au-auld La-ang Syne We'll take a cup of kindness yet For the sake of Auld Lang Syne.

2.) Let's have a drink or maybe two O-or maybe three or four Or five or six or sev'n or eight O-or maybe even more.

For Au-auld La-ang Syne, my dear, For Au-auld La-ang Syne We'll take a cup of kindness yet For the sake of Auld Lang Syne.

3.) And when it gets to closing time A-and if you still want more, I know a pub in Inverness Tha-at never shuts its door.

For Au-auld La-ang Syne, my dear, For Au-auld La-ang Syne We'll take a cup of kindness yet For the sake of Auld Lang Syne.
