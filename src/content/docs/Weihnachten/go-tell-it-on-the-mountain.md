title:  Go tell it on the mountain
---

When I was a learner, I sought both night and day. I asked the Lord to help me And He showed me the way.

Go tell it on the mountain, Over the hills and every where Go tell it on the mountain That Jesus Christ is born

While shepherds kept their watching, O'er wand'ring flock by night; Behold! From out of heaven, There shone a holy light.

**Go tell it on the mountain …**

They found a lovely manger Where the humble Christ was born And God sent out salvation On that blessed Christmas morn

**Go tell it on the mountain …**

He made me a watchman, Upon the city wall. And if I am a Christian I am the least of all.

**Go tell it on the mountain …**
