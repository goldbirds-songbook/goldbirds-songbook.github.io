title:  Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
---

Hark! The herald angels sing Glory to the newborn King; Peace on earth and mercy mild; God and sinners reconciled. Joyful, all ye nations rise, Join the triumph in skies; With angelic host proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem! Hark the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King.

Christ by highest heavn adored, Christ the everlasting Lord: Late in time, behold Him come, Offspring of a virgins womb. Veiled in flesh the Godhead see, Hail thincarnate Deity! Pleased as man with men to dwell, Jesus our Immanuel. Hark! the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King.

Hail the heavn born Prince of Peace! Hail the Sun of righteousness! Light and life to all He brings, Risn with healing in His wings. Mild He lays His glory by, Born that man no more may die, Born to raise the sons of earth, Born to give them second birth. Hark! the herald angels sing, Glory to the newborn King.
