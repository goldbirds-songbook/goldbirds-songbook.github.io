We wish you a merry Christmas

We wish you a merry Christmas

We wish you a merry Christmas

And a happy New Year.

**Good tidings we bring To you and your kin; We wish you a merry Christmas And a happy New Year!**

Now bring us some figgy pudding

Now bring us some figgy pudding

Now bring us some figgy pudding

Please bring it right here!

**Good tidings we bring …**

For we all like figgy pudding

For we all like figgy pudding

For we all like figgy pudding

So bring some out here!

**Good tidings we bring …**

We won't go until we get some

We won't go until we get some

We won't go until we get some

So bring it out here!

**Good tidings we bring …**
