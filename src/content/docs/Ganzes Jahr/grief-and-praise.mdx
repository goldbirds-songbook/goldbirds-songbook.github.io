Grief and praise [1], grief and praise  
Oh the world it turns around  
Grief and praise, grief and praise  
I was lost, now I am found  
[Repeat]  

  
Can you feel it in your bones, yeah, in your bones  
Crackin’ you open like a stone, yeah, like a stone  
I wanna feel it in my bones, yeah, in my bones  
Crackin’ me open like a stone, yeah, like a stone  
  
There’s no wrong way to cry  
We all have our day to die  
It’s written in history that death is a mystery  
With love, I know that we can get by... oh  
  
Grief and praise, grief and praise  
Oh the world it turns around  
Grief and praise, grief and praise  
I was lost, now I am found  
[Repeat]  
  
Can you feel it in your bones, yeah, in your bones  
Crackin’ you open like a stone, yeah, like a stone  
I wanna feel it in my bones, yeah, in my bones  
Crackin’ me open like a stone, yeah, like a stone  
  
They hold us and make it all right  
With their rose-colored honey light  
It’s written in history that death is a mystery  
With love, I know that we can get by... oh  
  
Grief and praise, grief and praise  
Oh the world it turns around  
Grief and praise, grief and praise  
I was lost, now I am found  
[Repeat]
